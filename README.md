In this project, you will implement a distributed key-value store (GTStore) system.
Nodes in this system should communicate with **network calls**.
You should give special attention to system properties such as: (i) scalability, (ii) availability, (iii) resilience to temporary node failures.
Implementation in C/C++. This can be done as a pair (team of 2 students).

You may discuss ideas with students in the class, but raw source code must not be shared.
Copying others is NEVER allowed for any reason.
